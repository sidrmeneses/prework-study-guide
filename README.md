# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to create a virtual study guide that is easy for students to understand. This project was built to not only create a study guide of the prework materials, but learn more about programs like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. This solves the problem of studying strenuous loads of material and concentrates topics into smaller, managable pieces to study. I learned how to code a website, how to upload all my work into GitHub, and adopt a sense of humor to get over my mistakes along the way.
